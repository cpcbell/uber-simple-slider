uber-simple-slider
==================

A very simple HTML5 image slider.

The purpose is to have a very minimal set of requirements and an extremely light-weight, flexible image slider.

The example file 'uber-simple-slider.html' is using and including:

Foundation 5 framework html5 basic template
Foundation 5 framework modernizr.js 
Foundation 5 framework jquery.js 
and optionally a current version of jquery-ui.js to enable effects

The CSS and jQueyr are included embedded on page in the example uber-simple-slider.html.

There are sections commented out for enabling/disabling effects provided by jQuery UI.

The .css and .js files are identical versions of the CSS and JS embedded in the example.

There is a demo example here:

Hope you enjoy it,
